# MWS project "restaurant" - Stage 3
Repository for my restaurant project of Udacity's MWS nanodegree.

> Stage 1: The restaurant site now is responsive, utilizes a service worker for static and runtime caching and has improved accessibility.  
> Stage 2: The project now receives data from a dynamic backend, which is stored/cached in IndexedDB.  
> Stage 3: The project allows adding new user reviews which are synced in the background, marking/unmarking restaurants as favorite and has performance improvements.
